# Required libraries are imported
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Lat/lon in decimal degrees provided for Honolulu, HI
lat = '21.33'
lon = '157.94'

# Url from the National Weather Service for Honolulu (specifically Daniel K Inouye International Airport) is pasted
url = "https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=21.3049&lon=-157.8579#.X2OnbpNKgnU"

# Web page is retrieved using the get() function from the requests library
# The page variable stores the response from the web-page
page = requests.get(url)

# BeautifulSoup object is created with the response from the URL and contents of the web page are accessed using .content
# html_parser is used because the page is in HTML format
soup=BeautifulSoup(page.content,"html.parser")

# The element to be scraped is called "current_conditions_detail" and find() locates the element in the BeautifulSoup object
cur_climate_honolulu = soup.find(id="current_conditions_detail")

# Text is extracted from the selected BeautifulSoup object using .text
cur_climate_honolulu = cur_climate_honolulu.text

# Final Output
print('The Current Climate at '+ lat +  ", " + lon + " (Honolulu, HI) is:" + cur_climate_honolulu)
