# Lab 3 â€“ Web Scraping Weather Data - Chikondi

This script gathers data from the National Weather Service website to display climate conditions for Honolulu, HI. The inputs are elements scraped from the website in order to display the output information, which consists of climate conditions including humidity, wind speed, barometer, dewpoint, visibility, and heat index. Initially, I found it difficult to locate things on the web page, but after some trial and error, I realised it wasn't too difficult. I'm not sure why the text at the bottom of the output that displays the heat index and last update is out of line, and I couldn't figure out what the issue was. Apart from that, the lab was interesting and I can see how it will be useful in other applications.
